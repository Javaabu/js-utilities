# JS Utilities

JS Utilities provides helpful JavaScript functionalities that you can use in your Laravel app.

For example, here's how you can show a confirmation message before a form is submitted on a button press.

```html
<button class="btn btn-danger" type="submit" data-confirm="Are you sure you want to delete this?">
    Delete
</button>
```
